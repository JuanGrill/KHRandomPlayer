## Q&A:
- Why takes too long to fetch a song?
   - At this time, the random song function of the site works a bit slow and sometimes fails to load. So, getting a lot of random songs could take a while.
 
- The program found and played a song who was life changing, but it got skipped after it finished and I couldn't download it. Is there a way to get it?
   - Currently, there's no song history. However, its a intended feature, so please stay tuned!
 
- Who is the creature who appears in the cover section and in the program icon?
   - Its Pommy! Please go and play Bomberman 64 TSA!
 
- The code is a mess. Can I improve it?
   - Yes, you can improve the code, ~~break it, destroy it,dream about it, use it to order pizza~~.

## Troubleshooting:
- The program isn't runnning.
	 - Try installing .NET Framework 4.7.2.
 
- The program throws a "Error in server" message constantly.
   - Check your internet connection.
 
- The song doesn't play and there's no "Error in server" message.
   - Check your current configuration. Click on settings (Button with a gear) and reduce the Minimum song length to 30.
 
- The program crashes randomly or there's another issue with it.
   - Woops, maybe its my fault. Please open an issue and I will check it out.
